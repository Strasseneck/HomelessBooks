# HomelessBooks

This project is both my capstone project for CS50W Web Development with Javascript and Python and an application with real utility for a friend's book-selling business. It's primary goal is to streamline book listing and pricing and efficiently manage the inventory.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Developed using Django, providing a robust foundation, makes use of Python's requests library and Beautiful Soup for webscraping.
- **Frontend:** Utilizes JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap for a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- Integration with Google Books API for automated book information retrieval and form population.
- I've utilized the [Abebooks Rest API](https://github.com/ravila4/abebooks) to retrieve Abebooks price info and wrap it in a custom Class for rendering.
- Custom web scraping module leveraging Beautiful Soup to scrape Booklooker for pricing and book information.
- Dynamic and easy to understand user interface for sorting and interacting with the seller's inventory of books.
- Custom dark theme and look based on the client's preferences.

## Images

Got to take a break because of doing Codeworks course, so here's a few pics of the current look and design. I'll do a video when I have a chance.
